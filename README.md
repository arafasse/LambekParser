Abstract: Lambek Syntactic Calculus has been invoked to analyze the syntax of a wide variety of languages, including English, German, Italian, Japanese, and Persian. To date, however, most algebraic investigations of this sort have been anecdotal and qualitative, relying on a cursory analysis of just a smattering of sentences in any given language. In this master's dissertation, I have designed and implemented a customizable, portable parsing algorithm for the large-scale algebraic analysis of parallel corpuses. My hope is that upon further development, this approach might constitute a novel, syntax-driven technique for phylogenetic analysis. I have successfully applied my program to sentences in German, Mandarin, Tibetan, and Baima (a Tibeto-Burman language of contested genetic affiliation), thereby demonstrating the feasibility of automatic pregroup parsing. Although my data sets were too small to yield any iron-clad quantitative results, I was able to obtain average Degree of Nesting values for all four languages that are consistent with intuition and empirical observation.
